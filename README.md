# InventoryMaker
InventoryMaker is an open-source Roblox module to help developers create their own inventory system. It replaces the default Roblox one, and allows you to define the structure and behavior of your inventory. It is completely customizable; you can use any UI design for your inventory. InventoryMaker handles the frontend side of your inventory system and the backend side with InventoryMakerServer (IMS).
